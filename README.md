##Missouri Highway Patrol - Crash Report

The Missouri Highway Patrol manages a [website](https://www.mshp.dps.missouri.gov/HP68/SearchAction) that 
shares all initial crash reports data to general public. The data isn't
deep but very wide and offers a nice playground for developers/analyst to try out new
techniques like GIS.
